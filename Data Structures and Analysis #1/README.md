# Goals:
• create dictionaries using varied value types;
• manipulate those dictionaries and their values;
• use data structures to perform some data analysis;
• read CSV data from files;
• allow data to persist using files;
• handle simple exceptions generated by your program (IndexError and FileNotFoundError).

# Task:
The program will ingest feb_2021_to_oct_2022_vaccinations.csv data in this form

and transform it to a dictionary with keys as the date (column A) and values as a list of vaccination counts for all locations per date (columns B, C, D, E, and F): 

{'2021-02-07': ['14543', '174', '0', '0', '275'], 

'2021-02-14': ['14042', '256', '644', '0', '275'],

etc.

The program then sums up the vaccination counts in each list to form a dictionary with Dates as the keys and the total vaccination count per date as the values. The program will then export the data in the form shown below in a csv file after adding headers for the two columns.
