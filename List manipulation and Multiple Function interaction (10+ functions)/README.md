# The objective of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of how to:
• Create and modify lists;

• Use list methods (e.g., append());

• Use list operators;

• Use file input in your code;

• Export to files;

• Process strings.

# Challenges:
manipulate lists in functions without using return statements in functions.
The use of local lists only.
multiple loop handling (loops within loops within loops).
