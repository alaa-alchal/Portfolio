# The objective of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of how to:
• create and modify lists;\n
• use list methods (e.g., append());\n
• use list operators;\n
• use file input in your code;
• export to files; and
• process strings.

# Challenges:
manipulate lists in functions without using return statements in functions
The use of local lists only
multiple loop handling (loops within loops within loops)
