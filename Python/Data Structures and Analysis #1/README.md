# Note:
The series of Data Structures and Analysis mini-projects are presented from least to most complex; i.e. Data Structures and Analysis #3 is the most complex and Data Structures and Analysis #1 is the least complex.
# Goals:
• Create dictionaries using varied value types;

• Manipulate those dictionaries and their values;

• Use data structures to perform some data analysis;

• Read CSV data from files;

• Allow data to persist using files;

• Handle simple exceptions generated by your program (IndexError and FileNotFoundError).
# Challenge
The challenge of this assignment is to be able to maniplulate different data structures no matter how complex the data is. I am mentioning this because there is an easier way to reach the end result, but I intend to manipulate complex data structures.

# Task:
The program will ingest feb_2021_to_oct_2022_vaccinations.csv data in this form

and transform it to a dictionary with keys as the date (column A) and values as a list of vaccination counts for all locations per date (columns B, C, D, E, and F): 

{'2021-02-07': ['14543', '174', '0', '0', '275'], 

'2021-02-14': ['14042', '256', '644', '0', '275'],

etc.}

The program then sums up the vaccination counts in each list to form a dictionary with Dates as the keys and the total vaccination count per date as the values. The program will then export the data in the form shown below in a csv file after adding headers for the two columns.
