# Goals:
• create dictionaries using varied value types;

• manipulate those dictionaries and their values;

• use data structures to perform some data analysis;

• read CSV data from files;

• allow data to persist using files;

• handle simple exceptions generated by your program.

# Challenge
The challenge of this assignment is to be able to maniplulate different data structures no matter how complex the data is. I am mentioning this because there is an easier way to reach the end result, but I intend to manipulate complex data structures.
# Task:
The program tranforms data from this form:

<img width="375" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-30 at 1 06 08 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119257994/204720429-6dfd4ddc-5f09-4edc-a361-9bac004b2861.png">

to a list of tuples with each tuple containing the date at which the vaccine was administered in the first index position and a tuple (tuple in a tuple) with the details of the individual in the second position (Sex, Age, and Location). The data structure is demonstrated below:

[('2022-08-11', ('Female', '80+', 'City of London')), ('2022-08-11', ('Female', '20-29', 'City of London')), 
('2022-08-11', ('Male', '60-69', 'City of London')), ('2022-08-11', ('Female', '80+', 'City of London')), 
('2022-08-12', ('Female', '40-49', 'City of London')), ('2022-08-12', ('Male', '20-29', 'City of London')), 
('2022-08-12', ('Female', '70-79', 'City of London')), ('2022-08-14', ('Male', '70-79', 'City of London')), 
('2022-08-14', ('Female', '80+', 'City of London')), ('2022-08-14', ('Female', '20-29', 'City of London')), 
('2022-08-15', ('Male', '80+', 'City of London')), ('2022-08-15', ('Male', '0-19', 'City of London')), etc.]

Then the program groups the tuples by date in a dictionary with dates as keys and values as a list of tuples in this form:

{

2022-11-04  :  [('Male', '70-79', 'City of London'), ('Male', '80+', 'City of London'), ('Female', '80+', 'City of London'), etc.]

2022-11-05  :  [('Female', '80+', 'City of London'), ('Female', '20-29', 'City of London'), ('Female', '30-39', 'City of London'), etc.]

2022-11-06  :  [('Male', '20-29', 'City of London'), ('Male', '80+', 'City of London'), ('Male', '80+', 'City of London'), etc.]

2022-11-07  :  [('Female', '40-49', 'City of London'), ('Female', '70-79', 'City of London'), ('Male', '80+', 'City of London'), etc.]

}

Then the program does some computations and exports the insights shown below in a txt file:
