# WORK IN PROGRESS


# Creating the tables:

Run the codes in the file: Create the tables

You will have to create a database and a Schema before creating the tables.

CREATE DATABASE project --creating a database

CREATE SCHEMA raw_data --creating a schema

# Populating the data:

Run the codes in the file: Populating the data

Note that you need to run then 1000 rows at a time, so 8 runs per table. 

Another note to mention is that all columns in global_population are in the data type string due to errors that occured when running date_year and population_size in an INT form.
