# Process Documentation:
The prorgam will start with a welcome note, then ask you how far are you from the restaurant. Only individuals within a 30km range will be allowed to order online. The program will provide you the surcharge, and you will have 2 options: cancel delivery or continue to order.

These are 2 samples:

The program will then ask you a series of questions on what items to add to card. The options are meal, appetizer, dessert, and beverages. For instance, it will ask you what would you like to order and display multiple options. If you type "meal", it will recommend "Pizza" or "Calzone". 

This is a list of all the prices:

The program will then ask you how many Pizzas for example would you like to order. If you type 3, it will ask you about the choice of the pizza "Vegan or Non-vegan" for each of the Pizzas. The vegan option is more expensive, and $2.5 will be added to cart op top of the original price for every vegan option

After finishing the Pizza selection, the program will ask you if you'd like to order anything else. Typing "y" will re-run the ordering section while tying "n" will take you to checkout.

Now there are 2 types of discounts offered:
1. If you purchased at least one meal with at least one beverage, you will receive a 5% discount at the end
2. If you purchased at meal one item from the 4 main options (meal, appetizer, dessert, and beverages), you will receive a 15% discount
This is a sample:

The program will then calculate your total with 13% tax and assess whether you qualify for a discount or not.

The program will add a flat rate delivery fee of 3.99 plus a surcharge depending on your distance from the restaurant.

The program will also ask you to tip, and you will be required to enter a percentage.

The program will finally print you a receipt.

This is a sample of what the receipt will look like:

These are 2 basic orders (note that you can make the order as big as you want):
